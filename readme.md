> Centralized local network (one local db and api to call for all bots) database using a single embed model, collecting history and running retrieval augmented generation.
> All models (LLMs and embed) running via LM Studio server, ease of use, minimal setup and plug and play like capabilities for us.
> The LLMs are capable of freely communicating with humans and other LLMs at multiple on Discord.
> The Chat History Service being updated with vital information about the conversation, and being fed back to LLMs via a rolling window of 10 most recent messages and 10 via RAG.
